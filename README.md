# GDSC_AI-CNN-from-Scratch  

Problem Statement - Train a convolutional neural network to classify images of cars and bikes. You may get the data from any source. You are not allowed to use any pre-trained weights. Report the final test set accuracy.  
  
This project contains 1 CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model trained from scratch.  
The dataset used to train the CNN model contains 200 images of each, Bikes and Cars, in the training set and 20 images of each, Bikes and Cars, in the test set.
